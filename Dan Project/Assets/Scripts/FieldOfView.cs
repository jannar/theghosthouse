		In trigonometry a unit circle starts with 0 degrees at 3:00 and increases going counterclockwise (90 at 12:00, 180 at 9:00, and 270 at 6:00).
		But in Unity for whatever reason, 0 degrees starts at 12:00 and increases going 'clockwise' (90 at 3:00, 180 at 6:00, and 270 at 9:00).
		To convert we'll need to take angle x and subtract 90. This effectively means that cosine and sin need to be swapped whenever we use them.*/
